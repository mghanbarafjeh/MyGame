            should guess what the number is based on PC's guess and user feedback.

                                the biggest numbers based on user input are printed.

4. Find three smallest numbers: Opposite to the previous option, this module takes user inputs and returns the three smallest
                                   numbers when "-1" is taken as the user input.
